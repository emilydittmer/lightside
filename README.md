# Light Side

## Description

Light Side is a paired project created using React and Router to display components from the Star Wars API. On the loading page of the app, it randomized the opening crawl displayed in all the films and then allowed the user to view people, planets, vehicles or favorites. If the user added favorites, this would display. If not, it would prop the user to add favorites. This application emphasises Test Driven Development with Enzyme and Jest.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emilydittmer/lightside.git
```
Once you have cloned the repo, install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash

```

To view the app in action, run the following command in your terminal:

```

Then, go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to see the code running in the browser.
